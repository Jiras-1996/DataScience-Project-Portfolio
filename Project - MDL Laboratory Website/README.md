# MDL-Laboratory-Website-Project

In the old system my laboratory has use paper to collect a data. Itâ€™s not convenient when you want to see a summary result. When i working first day, i see this problem from old system and planing to create a new system for laboratory. It must easy to use and rapid for fixed when a website has a problem .

New system i use google site to create the website. It very easy to use because google developer has create this solution for non-programmer, you can create website with low-coding tool.
